functions to implement : 

- some file read wrapper 

- more powerfull strtok()

- checkout rust string library and implement 
  some of it's features

- strchr variant to get all occurences of a character 

- strchr variant to change all occurences of a character

- a heapsort function bc I think heaps are cool as fuck 

- that one "O(n) when there aint a lot of different stuff in the string" 
sort function

some stdio.h functions to redefine : 

sprintf 
snprintf 

build.sh : 
not done 



docs : 
not done 

portability : 
not tested I'll make a  test battery and run it on

I don't care about windows / macOS compatibility

debug: 
more debug needed ngl

support wide char : 
idk maybe in a release or smtg ? 
 

making repo cleaner : 

gpl message everywhere once I'm done 
docs 
using fancy restrict/register things maybe ? 
fancier makefile and source structures
