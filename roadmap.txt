general todo list 

docs : 
not done 

portability : 
not verified

more debug needed ngl

I'd like to make the library real portable at some point 
I'm not sure how much yet I'll think abt it when I'll 
do it lol
 

making repo cleaner : 

gpl message everywhere 
docs 
using fancy restrict things maybe ? 
fancier makefile and source structures
